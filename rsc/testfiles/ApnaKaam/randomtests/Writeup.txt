The problem was solved by breaking it into 4 main Boolean expressions.

1.Every Edge belongs to a subgraph
This boolean expression states that if e[i][j] exists then there exists a subgraph k, such that both i and j belong to k.

2.No subgraph is a subset of another subgraph
This boolean expression states that for all subgraphs k and l (k!=l), there exists an element in k that doesn't exist in l.

3.All subgraphs are totally connected
This boolean expression states that if there doesnt exist an edge between nodes i and j, then there is no subgraph such that both i and j are present in it.

4.No subgraph is empty
This boolean expression states that there is no subgraph such that no node belongs to it.

The clause that every node belongs to a subgraph is already covered in these cases.
